      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
            I am a Web Developer and
      Digital Strategist with a client-
      facing background, an eye for
      aesthetics, and a talent for
      writing. I am driven to master
      new technologies and
      programming languages, and
      am equally comfortable working
      independently and
      collaboratively.
